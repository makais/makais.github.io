However, rather than the drawings or computer models, the most frequently used representation during fabrication was the maquette.\nBear maquetteThe maquette’s condition attested to its utility. Assembly joints and parting lines were drawn in pen and pencil.\nThe maquette became a means of tracking panels in fabrication. It was essentially the shop drawing: not a digital twin but a physical one.\nThe it was used to design the construction logic: the parting lines and assembly joints.

Panels were made of fiberglass and polyester resin layup on CNC milled EPS foam molds. Tool paths were permitted to leave linear marks in the finished piece as both sculptural expression and a means to expedient milling via a large step-over distance.\nStructural BulkheadA view up into the bear shows transverse bulkheads for stiffness, intersected by the web of assembly joints.\nOnce assembled the individually constructed panels were indistinguishable, leaving only the keyed, bolted flanges separable for shipping and re-assembly on site.\nSpatial transformationThe green string lines represent the ground plane and facade of adjacent building to guide assembly.\n“I See What You Mean” is a hybrid construction: the Bear has a steel sub-structure up to its waist and is a monocoque structure from there up, as shown in elevation drawings above.\nLogisticsThe sculpture shipped on five flatbeds.\nEach of the pieces were light enough to be handled, skillfully, with a couple of forklifts and loaded on to trucks.\nInstallationBecause of its modular design, ‘I See What You Mean’ was installed in two days.\nThe light weight of its composite components allowed for erection using light-duty lifting and a small crew.\nBig Blue Bear in winterTaken soon after installation, this is a view now obscured by mature trees.\nI visited it for SIGGRAPH 2024, nearly twenty since its installation, and the Big Blue Bear is in good condition.
