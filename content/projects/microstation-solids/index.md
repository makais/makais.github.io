The force of gravity with MicroStation is strong.  Features settle down and never escape, aging, duplicating capabilities.  Case in point, MicroStation Feature Modeling, which was still present in V8i, despite being the last remnant of MicroStation Modeler, a MCAD product folded into the platform in the early 90's. It sat alongside of an entirely parallel set of conventional solids modeling tools. Around [some year] we finally replaced it with a new unified of parametric tools, fully integrated with element behaviors, and based on Parasolid's 2D and 3D D-Cubed solvers.
