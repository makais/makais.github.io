Concetto was a prototype generative and computational design environment for AEC.  It had high-performance Vulkan graphics with a portable React-like front end, on Windows and Linux for cloud services development. I was product management director, setting strategy and scaling up the teams of product managers, designers, and QA testers.

It had interactive 3D modeling tools with a visual scripting environment and a design-space explorer for optimization. The graph and interactive tools worked interchangeably, with unified selection behavior for a fluid modeling experience.

Designed as a platform for 3D AI and ML research, Concetto had a Python API for automation and creating custom nodes.
