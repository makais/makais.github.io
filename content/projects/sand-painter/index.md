Sand Painter was a large-scale installation exhibited at SIGGRAPH 2004, which created algorithmic patterns by depositing white silica sand onto a black surface approx. 12' x 18'. The project combined a custom-fabricated motion platform, custom deposition system, and software tooling to explore ephemeral image-driven patterning at architectural scale. 

I developed the computational interface that converted images into machine control instructions, translating digital data into physical sand patterns. This project represents an early exploration in my work combining digital representation, fabrication systems, and design tooling.

The core concept was initiated by artist Dan Collins, with additional collaborators contributing to CNC hardware, deposition mechanism, and integration.
