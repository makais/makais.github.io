# Digiplasty  
### Makai Smith

Welcome to Digiplasty — a platform for collaboration and exploration at the intersection of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) technology, artificial intelligence, digital fabrication, and spatial computing.

I’m Makai Smith, an architect, fabricator, and product strategist working across disciplines to prototype the future of design and construction. My current focus lies in:

- **AEC Software Innovation** — advancing the platforms that shape how we model, simulate, and build.
- **AI/ML in Design Workflows** — exploring how machine learning can augment ideation, optimization, and execution.
- **Computational and Generative Design** — investigating new forms of representation and agency in design.
- **Digital Fabrication and Interfaces** — developing workflows to translate computational models into physical form.
- **Spatial Computing** — integrating digital entities into real-world context through XR and geospatial data.
  
I'm open to collaborations, research, and conversation with individuals and teams pushing the boundaries of these domains.

This space will evolve to reflect active projects, experiments, and ideas in progress.
