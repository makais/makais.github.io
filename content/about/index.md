Digiplasty is a space for research about architecture, design tools, digital fabrication, and computation

Areas of interest:

- **AEC Platforms** — modeling, simulation, and coordination environments
- **Computational & Generative Methods** — associative parametric modeling and implicit methods
- **Digital Fabrication** — bridging models and material systems through design for manufacture
- **Digital Twins and Reality Capture** — data-rich models and geophysical context for spatial computing
- **Design Within Limits** - adaptive practices for a constrained and interdependent world

I welcome collaboration with individuals and teams reshaping design, construction, and operation of buildings and infrastructure.
