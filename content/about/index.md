description: "Generative design and fabrication in AEC"

This site documents [projects](/projects) and [essays](/posts) on architecture, design technology, and digital fabrication. It's a working archive focused on computational design, data-driven methods, and the intersection of building technology and business.

Areas of expertise:

- **Computational & Generative Design** — Associative parametric modeling and implicit AI/ML methods.
- **AEC Platforms** — Modeling, simulation, and coordination environments.
- **Digital Fabrication** — Design for manufacture, bridging models and material systems.
- **Digital Twins and Reality Capture** — Data-rich models and geophysical context for spatial computing.
- **High-performance Design** - Adaptive practices for a constrained and interdependent world.

I collaborate with individuals and teams advancing the design, construction, and operation of buildings and infrastructure.
