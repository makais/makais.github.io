Hello there!

**digiplasty** is a collection some of my professional and academic [projects](/projects/) and a place for research [posts](/posts).  It's primarily about architecture, digital fabrication, computer graphics, AI, and software product management. 

The word "digiplasty" originated from a digital sculpture collaboration, documented [here](/projects/digiplasty-collab/).  It captured a sense of digital materiality that, along with this domain name, has endured.

I also hope digiplasty becomes a catalyst for future collaborations.

If you would like to get in touch, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makai-smith/), or email me: contact [at] digiplasty [dot] com.
