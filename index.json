[{"content":"I once ended up at a SIGGRAPH dinner with Ken Perlin, who, in good humor, ranted about the death of parametricism at the hands of machine learning zealots. Let\u0026rsquo;s frame the fight.\nParametric associative modeling, exemplified by constraint graphs, rule engines, and systems like Grasshopper and GenerativeComponents, is the Swiss watchmaking of digital design tooling. It\u0026rsquo;s symbolically encoded and mostly human debuggable until complexity spirals beyond control. That\u0026rsquo;s the Robots team.\nOn the other side, as Andrej Karpathy recently described, LLMs are \u0026ldquo;people spirits, stochastic simulations of people where the simulator is an autoregressive transformer.\u0026rdquo; Inference engines\u0026ndash;for text, image, video, and eventually everthing else\u0026ndash;driven to consume knowledge. They eat brains, this is the Zombies team.\nAfter prompting ChatGPT-4o on Robots vs Zombies capturing the shift from a priori knowledge embedded in parametric modeling networks to frozen knowledge calcified in model weights:\nWe are moving from programmatic systems (robots) to trained systems (zombies).\nRobots = symbolic, rule-based, human-debuggable logic networks (e.g., parametric models, explicit rule engines, constraint graphs)\nZombies = end-to-end learned, data-distilled function approximators with frozen epistemologies (e.g., transformer weights, diffusion priors, RL-trained agents)\nImplications: Knowledge engineering shifts from authorship and transparency to harvesting and distillation\nThe fight-club metaphor, while rhetorically satisfying, is also reductive. It obscures genuine complexity of the problem space and the practical necessity of hybrids. Contrary to a zero-sum fight, a useful metaphor proposed by creative studio Takram is the pendulum: design oscillates between determinism and emergence, between authorship and automation. For example, somewhere along the frontier between Robot and Zombie we find agent orchestration frameworks such as LangGraph where LLMs call symbolic tools, DAGs govern control flow, and human-LLM interactions loop back through rule-based validation.\nPolemically, this contest deserves a formal panel: a staged competition where partisans earn points for Team Robot or Team Zombie. Practically, there will be no single victor; the real frontier is in harnessing the combined strengths of both.\n","permalink":"https://digiplasty.com/posts/robots-vs-zombies/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI once ended up at a SIGGRAPH dinner with Ken Perlin, who, in good humor, ranted about the death of parametricism at the hands of machine learning zealots.

However, rather than the drawings or computer models, the most frequently used representation during fabrication was the maquette.\nBear maquetteThe maquette\u0026rsquo;s condition attested to its utility. Assembly joints and parting lines were drawn in pen and pencil.\nThe maquette became a means of tracking panels in fabrication. It was essentially the shop drawing: not a digital twin but a physical one.\nThe it was used to design the construction logic: the parting lines and assembly joints. Assembly joints were permanently joined during fabrication. Parting lines allowed shipment and installation on site.\nFiberglass composite panelStill in its EPS foam mold, this panel shows a parting line constructed as a flange.\nFor strength, parting lines intersected assembly joints (panel edges) at their midpoint. Panels were made of fiberglass and polyester resin layup on CNC milled EPS foam molds. Tool paths were permitted to leave linear marks in the finished piece as both sculptural expression and a means to expedient milling via a large step-over distance.\nStructural BulkheadA view up into the bear shows transverse bulkheads for stiffness, intersected by the web of assembly joints.\nOnce assembled the individually constructed panels were indistinguishable, leaving only the keyed, bolted flanges separable for shipping and re-assembly on site.\nSpatial transformationThe green string lines represent the ground plane and facade of adjacent building to guide assembly.\n\u0026ldquo;I See What You Mean\u0026rdquo; is a hybrid construction: the Bear has a steel sub-structure up to its waist and is a monocoque structure from there up, as shown in elevation drawings above.\nLogisticsThe sculpture shipped on five flatbeds.\nEach of the pieces were light enough to be handled, skillfully, with a couple of forklifts and loaded on to trucks.\nInstallationBecause of its modular design, \u0026lsquo;I See What You Mean\u0026rsquo; was installed in two days.\nThe light weight of its composite components allowed for erection using light-duty lifting and a small crew.\nBig Blue Bear in winterTaken soon after installation, this is a view now obscured by mature trees.\nI visited it for SIGGRAPH 2024, nearly twenty since its installation, and the Big Blue Bear is in good condition.
