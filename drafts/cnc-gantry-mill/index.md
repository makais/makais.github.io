The shop's gantry mill failed not long after I joined. The drives and control system were irretrievably old, and it was unergonomic to load and run. We utilized its stanchions to build a new machine. We repurposed the truss built for the Sand Painter project, adding a plate and long Z axis.

We designed and built a new machine, with a working area of approx. 12’ x 24’ x 4’. A consulting engineer did the mechanical design, and we fabricated and installed the machine in-house. I procured and installed the servos, electronics, and computer interface.
